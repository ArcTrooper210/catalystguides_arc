## Max Enchanting Setup

??? information "Max Enchanting Shelves List"
	- [ ] 5x **Echoing Sculkshelf**
	- [ ] 5x **Soul-Touched Sculkshelf**
	- [ ] 1x **Deepshelf of Arcane Treasures**

Craft 16x **Seashelf** and place all but one in the usual enchanting configuration.

Now take your last Seashelf and **infuse it**. You should see an infusion option for 3 EXP. Now replace one of the uninfused **Seashelf** with your **Infused Seashelf**. Repeat this until all 16 `Seashelf` are `Infused Seashelf`. You will have one extra `Infused Seashelf`.

!!! info "You must be level 45+ to infuse Seashelves"

After all of shelves are infused, you'll need to break 13x Infused Seashelf and craft 13x **Crystalline Seashelf**. After you're done crafting them, place them down.

Now craft 10x **Dormant Deepshelf** and infuse them into their **Deepshelf** varient.

!!! info "You must be level 60+ to infuse Dormant Deepshelves"

After infusing all 10 dormant deepshelves, use them to craft 5x **Soul-Touched Sculkshelf** and 5x **Echoing Sculkshelf**.

!!! tip "Remember to use JEI to see the recipes. You'll need to kill a few Wardens"

---

Now you'll need to craft 1x **Geode-Encased Bookcase of Stability**.

You can infuse a **Block of Amethyst** to get **Budding Amethyst**. Place 10x **Crystalline Seashelf** and 5x **Normal Bookshelves** to infuse it.
