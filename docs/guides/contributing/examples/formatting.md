![](img/hlChangesDark.png#only-dark)

Text can be {--deleted--} and replacement text {++added++}. This can also be
combined into {~~one~>a single~~} operation. {==Highlighting==} is also
possible {>>and comments can be added inline<<}.

Formatting can also be applied to blocks by putting the opening and closing
tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content.

The homomorphism $f$ is injective if and only if its kernel is only the
singleton set $e_G$, because otherwise $\exists a,b\in G$ with $a\neq b$ such
that $f(a)=f(b)$.
