# Icons and Emojis

You can use icons and emojis to enhance your Catalyst Guides!

## Icons

For icons to work, you must add `:material-` before the icon shortcode and add a closing colon.

Use [:material-material-design: Material Design](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) to look up icon shortcodes!

Icons can also have [hoverable tooltips!](formatting.md/#tool-tips)

`:material-airplane:` :material-airplane:

`:material-application-braces-outline:` :material-application-braces-outline:

`:material-barcode-scan:` :material-barcode-scan:

---

## Emojis

You can use emojis by using shortcodes from the **GitHub column** of [Emojibase](https://emojibase.dev/shortcodes/) between two colons.
