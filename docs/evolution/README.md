# Catalyst Evolution

The **Evolution pack** sets out to do what every kitchen sink should be doing, but has recently *failed* to achieve; to take you from the start to end of a Minecraft version with new content added regularly, ensuring you're playing a modpack centered around quality, stability, and multiplayer-based playthroughs. 

There will be some custom content in this pack alongside popular mods we all know and love, without gating you unnecessarily along the way.

Refamiliarise yourself with mods such as **Mystical Agriculture**, **Applied Energistics 2 (+Addons)**, **Mekanism**, **Biomes o' Plenty**, and more! As content is released for **1.21.1**, it will be added *swiftly* and *seamlessly*, all thanks to unification being handled using **KubeJS** and **Almost Unified**.

World generation should always be kept simple, yet feel fun to explore and traverse through, which is why we have gone with the fan favourite of **Biomes o' Plenty**. By sticking with one world generation mod, we can offer a clean, efficient world that will not lag you out when your friends explore deeper into the world. This reiterates our commitment to a quality modpack perfect for playing with friends.
